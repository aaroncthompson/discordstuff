These are just quick things I've written for use with AutoCode to provide functionality in my friends' Discord server. Feel free to take and modify for your own use!

## event.js
Syntax: `/event eventname description (imageurl) (emoji) (channel)`

Creates a role, a private channel restricted to the invoker and that role, a post in a specified channel (`#rsvp` by default), and a confirmation message containing a command the invoker can copy/paste to call [Carl-bot](https://carl.gg/) to add a reaction role to the post to allow users to opt in to private channels about upcoming events or topics by clicking the emoji Carl-bot reacts to the post with.
