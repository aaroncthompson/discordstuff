These are just quick things I've written for use with AutoCode to provide functionality in my friends' Discord server. Feel free to take and modify for your own use!

## event.js
Syntax: `/event eventname description (imageurl) (emoji)`
Creates a role, a private channel restricted to the invoker and that role, and a post in a designated `#rsvp` channel. In our server, we use it in conjunction with [Carl-bot](https://carl.gg/)'s `/reactionrole add` command to allow users to opt in to private channels about upcoming events or topics by clicking the emoji Carl-bot reacts to the post with.
